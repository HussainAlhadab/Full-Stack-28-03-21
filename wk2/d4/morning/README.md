- Recap Monday's Pokemon code...
  - What is called a Promise
  - Asynchronous - means while this request does something, the rest of the programming doesn't wait, it continues to operate
  - .then and .catch
  - Get Request vs Post Request
  - anonymous vs arrow functions
    - function(variable) {}
    - (variable => {})
- Let's write it in jQuery


examples of arrow functions:
response => response.json()
function(response) {
  response.json()
}

function() {
  console.log("hello world")
}
hello = () => {
  console.log("hello world")
}
