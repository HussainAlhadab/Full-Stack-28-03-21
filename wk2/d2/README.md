## Hello everyone!
Here are some notes today to get started:
- Algos are in the algo.js file
- `morning` folder has notes and code for the morning video about DOM
- `afternoon` folder has notes and code for the afternoon video about more JS Functions
- and lastly an `extra` folder with notes and code for something to intro tomorrow's jQuery

### Algo Tips:
#### When solving algorithms, use RIOTWALK..
- R - Repeat the problem
- I - Input - What are the Inputs?
- O - Output - What is the expected Output?
- T - Test the code
- WALK - Walkthrough the code

### Meet With Your Teams (optional today)
- Discuss solution and strategy together
- One person to host a LiveShare on VSCode
    - If LiveShare does not work:
        - Share Screen with each other

### Upkeep
- Keep a copy of solutions in an organized place.
- Write comments and pseudo code to understand what and how the solution works
- Doing these things will help you stay sharp!
