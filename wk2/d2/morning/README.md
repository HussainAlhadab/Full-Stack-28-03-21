# WHAT IS THE DOM?
## Document Object Model
### Now we can add some interaction with Javascript to our HTML

#### DOM is...
- Like a big container
    - Similar to our OOP discussion yesterday, it holds a lot of properties and methods.
        - We can target document elements directly

### Some Examples...
- DOM Events
    - in HTML
    - in JavaScript
    - in JavaScript using addEventListener()
