## EXAM CODE WILL BE EMAILED EARLY TOMORROW MORNING

- Come to zoom at 9am and breakout rooms will be open so you can take advantage of the `Call for Help` feature.
- Remember you cannot ask your friends for help and you must code on your own
- You can reference class repo, your previous assignments, and platform code.. but you may not use code from other repos, or anyone else
- When you ask for help, please do not ask how to do something. You can ask "Yes" or "No" question.
  - e.g.: "Does abc look correct?"
  - e.g.: "I have an error in abc, is xyz where i should look?"
- When you are done with exam, you can ask to check if it is passing
- If you are stuck on exam for more than an hour, ask for a hint.
- Double check your final work before submitting-- does it match what exam is asking for?
