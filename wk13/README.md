## Couple Reminders about exam and grading process in 3rd Stack:

### **Will be graded firmly based on wireframe and instructions**

- Projects upon submission must work with basic installation: `dotnet restore`
  - Or you will be asked to provide a video demo
- Ask for clarification if you are unsure about the wireframe and features
  - Do not guess what it should do or should look like
- Exam is not passing if you are missing any of the red belt features even if you attempted black belt features
- Pay attention to details. I will not be asking you to resubmit to fix small things that doesn't meet criteria.
  - It will be none passing and you will have to retake.
- 70% Style match
- Double check your code and comments to make sure it is your own code.
