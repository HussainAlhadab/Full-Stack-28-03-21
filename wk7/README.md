### Stress Management

## keep in mind

- MERN is reputed to be the hardest stack in the program so to stay focused and on track, keep a close eye on your understanding and write down topics that make or do not make sense. Maybe all it takes it to hear about it again to be clear? But you have to talk about it so your learning is solidified
- just because it is an 'easier stress' day, do not mistaken it for a day to be skipped. There is still a lot of information that will carry over to the next day and missing days will be detrimental to overall success.
- if you need to be absent from class, please let instructor know in advanced.
- :heavy_exclamation_mark:Important to practice code and not just watch lectures on your screen
  - be sure to open VS Code every day and create at least 1 project and practice what was covered in class
