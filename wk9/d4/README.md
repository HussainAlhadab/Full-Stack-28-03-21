## Scoring

- 8/10 minimum red belt

## General Info

- It's common to have to re-take the exam, success rate is dramatically higher on the 2nd attempt.
- To enter code: go to https://learn.codingdojo.com/dashboard or click back to tracks -> click exams at the top
- 5 hour timer will start when exam code is entered
- Download exam assets and take screenshot or copy instruction text (in the event of an internet disconnection)
- Open book / open notes / can use google
- NO HELPING EACH OTHER. It's easy to spot shared code. DO NOT share exam info with those who haven't taken it.
- Focus on functionality and red belt requirements first, do not spend a lot of time on CSS, until you have everything working, then attempt black belt requirements
- Use a Checklist To Track Completed Requirements & For Testing
- Check off each requirement when completed
- Any time a change is made near the end, go through the checklist again testing each requirements and checking it off to make sure nothing broke what was working before
- If you have a problem uploading your project zip, email it to: mhong@codingdojo.com, nbell@codingdojo.com, and aabbad_p@mcit.gov.sa
- No need for video if you showed exam to intructor

## PLAGIARISM

- You can repurpose / edit learn platform code, stack overflow, or lecture code to make it work for you, HOWEVER if you copy paste LARGE amounts of code without any changes, that is considered plagiarism. Students have been EXPELLED for plagiarism.
- Other examples: cloning entire online repos of a past students exam, sharing exam code with other students, etc. We have had to expel students for these violations as well.

## Questions

- Can ask for clarification (what something is, but not how to do it)

## Exam Day

- Optional: Ask for a precheck before submitting
- Black Belt: Work on deployment after exam and taking a break, sent ip address when complete
