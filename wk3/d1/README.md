# And so our journey to Python begins...

## But first! Some algos to loosen up our brains!

### Algos will continue to be in JavaScript
- Consistently build up skills

### This week's theme is: STRING
- Similar to arrays last week, we will be focusing on how to manipulate strings

### Same actions
- Work with your team to collaborate
- Take turns sharing screen and typing the solution
    - Learn about `Pair Programming`
- Bonus: try considering case situations for each algo and solve for them

### Remember
- It is better to learn how a solution works than to memorize what the code is
- Keep a file everyday in your folder to review later
