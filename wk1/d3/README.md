# So You Wanna Do Algos?

### Begin...
- Obtain code - https://github.com/M0M0-D3V/Full-Stack-28-03-21/tree/main/wk1/d3/algo.js
- Ask questions if something needs clarifying
    - example:
        - can we use additional data structures?
        - what does it need to return?
        - etc

### Meet With Your Teams
- Discuss solution and strategy together
- One person to host a LiveShare on VSCode
    - If LiveShare does not work:
        - Share Screen with each other

### Upkeep
- Keep a copy of solutions in an organized place.
- Write comments and pseudo code to understand what and how the solution works
- Doing these things will help you stay sharp!
