  - Communication is just as important, if not more, than coding skills

### Pass Exam to continue next stack

- The goal of the exam is to be a professional skill check to verify if the student has understood enough concepts to demonstrate proficiency in each stack
- Remember: It is okay to have to retake the exam and it is very common, in fact, retaking will only make you a stronger developer
- Not passing the exam just means that there are gaps in knowledge that need to be filled and there will more opportunities to make it up
