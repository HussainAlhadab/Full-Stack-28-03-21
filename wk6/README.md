# EXAM CONCLUSION / RETAKE

## Exam Concern and Warning

- First warning:
- Found 7 exams with matching models, urls, and views
- Possible shared code or searched same public repo online
- <img src="snippet.png" alt="snippet">
- Important to complete the exam on your own

### Academic Dishonesty + Plagiarism

- You may use google or stackoverflow to find solutions to reference but do not copy and paste
- It is EASY to spot copied code
  - Looking for code that reads uniformly with the rest of the code
- Consequences will be probation and expulsion from program
### Red flags

- Different naming conventions
  - if using camel_case in variable names and suddenly change to camelCase
- if variable names and code style does not match previous turned in assignments
- if there are no changes to code copied from Instructor Repo
- if there is exact same spelling issues
- using patterns and logic style not covered in class
- unique variable namings that have meaning to a specific student

### Advice

- Reference class notes before googling for solutions
  - Most criteria on the Exam, if not all, are discussed in class demo and are in the Repo
- Ask questions to clarify if Models are hard to figure out
  - Can ask for Model check before migrating
- Remember this exam is like a checkpoint in a game. To assess how much you can do in 5 hours
    - Retaking an exam is very common - There are instructors who have taken the exams 8 times!
    - Only become better developer
    - Easier the second time around

## Retaking Exam

### Retake will be different exam

- Ask for help or work together to complete Wish app exam
- When finished, ask for check to show your exam works and you can obtain new exam code
- Complete all red belt requirements and get it checked before going onto Black Belt requirements
    - Will not pass if any of the red belt items are not completed even if you tried some black belt features

## Deploying

- Must be AWS because this is industry standard
- Can take the week to complete deploy
- Can ask for help
