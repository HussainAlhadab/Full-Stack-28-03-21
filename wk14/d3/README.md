## Tip of the Day: Keep up a routine
What helped me the most was to maintain the bootcamp schedule 9am-5pm the best I can and instead of bootcamp stuff, I did job searching tasks as well as daily algorithm. After my EOD Goal, I took a break and then continued my coding projects. This helped me to prioritize my day and have some sort of structure in the chaos that is job searching and combining that with working on projects.

### Sidenote.. if ever any task feels overwhelming
- Give yourself permission to do the task "half-ass" or break it down smaller steps to make it easier. Because getting some done is still way better than getting nothing done at all.
- Ask a friend how would they tackle it and much time do they estimate to take?
